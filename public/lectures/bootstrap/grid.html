                Early on, when HTML and browsers first came out in 1993, many realized the ease with which content could be created (HTML) and consumed (browsers). With so much content being created we quickly discovered both the potential and limits of HTML.
                One of the limitiations was that many concepts from printed media did not readily translate to HTML. Particularly laying out content horizontally was a challenge. A solution that became very popular to 'solve' this 'perceived' limitation was to
                use the HTML table element. Table elements allow organizing content into rows and columns, from top to bottom and left to right. Tables also allow spanning content across several columns and rows which allows for some interesting layout.
